'''
 Replay buffer is a buffer containing all last N steps/episodes
 of the envirnoment. It is composed of different buffers:
   - states:            state in which it starts
   - actions:           action applied when it is in state
   - rewards:           reward obtained passing from state to next_state
   - next_states:       state where it arrives when applied action to state
   - dones:             done flag when it is in state
